  DESCRIPTION
================================================================================
C/C++-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably speed up writing code in
a consistent style.  This is done by inserting complete statements, idioms,
code snippets, templates, and comments.  Syntax checking, compiling,  running a
program, running indent or code checkers can be done with a keystroke.  There
are many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing C/C++. See the help file csupport.txt for more information.

================================================================================
  INSTALLATION
================================================================================

(1)  LINUX
----------

The subdirectories in the zip archive  cvim.zip  mirror the directory structure
which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/.vim/ (find the
value of $HOME with ":echo $HOME" from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in '$HOME/.vim/c-support/templates/Templates' if
    you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive cvim.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip cvim.zip

    If you have already an older version of c-support and you have modified
    the template files you may want to save your templates first and suppress
    overwriting them with

      unzip cvim.zip  -x *Templates *.template

(1.2) Loading of plugin files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

    This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. Create one if there
    is none or use the files in $HOME/.vim/c-support/rc as a starting point.

(1.3) Set at least some personal details in the file
    '$HOME/.vim/c-support/templates/Templates'
    Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

       SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Dr. Fritz Mehner' )
       SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'fgm' )
       SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'mehner.fritz@fh-swf.de' )
       SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION','FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn' )
       SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

    (Read more about the template system in the plugin documentation)

(1.4) Make the plugin help accessable by typing the following command on the
    Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/.vimrc'.  The files
    customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or extensions
    for your .vimrc and .gvimrc.  You may want to use parts of them. The files
    are documented.

(1.6) To enable additional tools, add these lines to your '$HOME/.vimrc'. To
    enable the CMake and Doxygen tools, use:

      let g:C_UseTool_cmake    = 'yes'
      let g:C_UseTool_doxygen  = 'yes'

    For enabling the Doxygen templates, see chapter 1.10.1 of the documentation:

      :help csupport-doxygen-enable

(2)  WINDOWS
------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive  cvim.zip  mirror the directory structure
which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/vimfiles/ (find
the value of $HOME with ":echo $HOME" from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in '$HOME/vimfiles/c-support/templates/Templates' if
    you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive cvim.zip to $HOME/vimfiles and run

      unzip cvim.zip

    If you have already an older version of c-support and you have modified
    the template files you may want to save your templates first and suppress
    overwriting them with

      unzip cvim.zip  -x *Templates *.template

(2.2) Loading of plugin files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

    This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/_vimrc'. Create one if there
    is none or use the files in $HOME/vimfiles/c-support/rc as a starting point.

(2.3) Set at least some personal details in the file
    '$HOME/vimfiles/c-support/templates/Templates'
    Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

       SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Dr. Fritz Mehner' )
       SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'fgm' )
       SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'mehner.fritz@fh-swf.de' )
       SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION','FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn' )
       SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

    (Read more about the template system in the plugin documentation)

(2.4) Make the plugin help accessible by typing the following command on the
    Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/_vimrc'.  The files
    customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or extensions
    for your _vimrc and _gvimrc. You may want to use parts of them.  The files
    are documented.

(2.6) To enable additional tools, add these lines to your '$HOME/_vimrc'. To
    enable the CMake and Doxygen tools, use:

      let g:C_UseTool_cmake    = 'yes'
      let g:C_UseTool_doxygen  = 'yes'

    For enabling the Doxygen templates, see chapter 1.10.1 of the documentation:

      :help csupport-doxygen-enable

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and tags
  *  surround marked blocks with statements
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  generate/remove multiline comments
  *  picking up prototypes
  *  C/C++ dictionaries for keyword completion
  *  (re)moving the root menu

Look at csupport help with

  :help csupport

or use the 'help' item in the root menu of this plug-in.

  Most of the people who have contributed ideas, patches,  and bug reports, is
  thanked in the file ChangeLog.
  I would like to especially thank my son Wolfgang Mehner, who has repeatedly
  proposed improvements and introduced new ideas.

  Some ideas are taken from the following documents:
  1. Recommended C Style and Coding Standards (Indian Hill Style Guide)
      http://ieng9.ucsd.edu/~cs30x/indhill-cstyle.html
      http://www.sourceformat.com/pdf/cpp-coding-standard-indianhill.pdf

  The splint error format is taken from the file splint.vim (Vim standard
  distribution).

  ... finally

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), the greatest of the German poets,
about LINUX, Vim/gVim and other great tools (Ok, almost.) :

 Ein Mann, der recht zu wirken denkt,     Who on efficient work is bent,
 Muß auf das beste Werkzeug halten.       Must choose the fittest instrument.
